# SupersonicWindGauge
This is an Arduino code for encoding the data from wind gauge (Url of the device : https://reurl.cc/mMMLV). 
The data is receive by using UART, so the rs232/rs485 module is required. 
This code is avaliable for arduino uno. If you use the Arduino micro, the Serial should change to Serial1.
